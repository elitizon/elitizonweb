# Live-server

[https://www.npmjs.com/package/live-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/live-server)

live-server is a little development server with live reload capability. Use it for hacking your HTML/JavaScript/CSS files, but not for deploying the final site.

There are two reasons for using this:

**AJAX requests don't work with the `file://` protocol due to security restrictions, i.e. you need a server if your site fetches content through JavaScript. Having the page reload automatically after changes to files can accelerate development.**

## How To

Create a directory ./www 

```bash
mkdir ./wwww
```

### Edit a simple html page such as index.html in the ./www directory

```html
<html>
  <header></header>
  <body>
    <h1>This is a simple test</h1>
  </body>
</html>
```

### Run the command live-server to expose the directory

```bash
live-server ./www

```
