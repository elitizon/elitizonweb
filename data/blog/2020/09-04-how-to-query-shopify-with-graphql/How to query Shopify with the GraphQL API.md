# How to query Shopify with the GraphQL API

## What problem do we solve

[Shopify](https://www.shopify.com)  provides an API that can be used to implement:

- A mobile application connected to a Shopify Front Store
- An integration pipeline with an external system such as a product management systems (PIM) or an enterprise resource planning (ERP)

**The** **Shopify API is proposed with 2 flavors:**

- [REST](https://www.notion.so/raphaelmansuy/How-query-Shopify-with-the-GraphQL-API-7d4dd7beeb144a7f8210f5fb904baff4)
- [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/)

This article describes how to query Shopify with GraphQL using [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/) a powerful API client.

### The graphQL Api

The test API is available at this EndPoint:

```
https://shopify.dev/tools/graphiql-admin-api
```

This endpoint can be used to experiment and play with Shopify GraphQL API.

A GraphQL query that returns the first 10 products:

```graphql
{
  
  products(first: 2) {
    pageInfo {
      hasNextPage
      hasPreviousPage
    }
    edges {
      cursor
      node
       {
        
        handle
        descriptionHtml
      }
    }
  }
  
}
```

Result:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "products": {
      "pageInfo": {
        "hasNextPage": true,
        "hasPreviousPage": false
      },
      "edges": [
        {
          "cursor": "eyJsYXN0X2lkIjoxOTc0MjA4Mjk5MDMwLCJsYXN0X3ZhbHVlIjoiMTk3NDIwODI5OTAzMCJ9",
          "node": {
            "handle": "rough-snowflake-camisole",
            "descriptionHtml": ""
          }
        },
        {
          "cursor": "eyJsYXN0X2lkIjoxOTc0MjA4MzMxNzk4LCJsYXN0X3ZhbHVlIjoiMTk3NDIwODMzMTc5OCJ9",
          "node": {
            "handle": "wandering-thunder-blouse",
            "descriptionHtml": ""
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  },
  "extensions": {
    "cost": {
      "requestedQueryCost": 4,
      "actualQueryCost": 4,
      "throttleStatus": {
        "maximumAvailable": 1000,
        "currentlyAvailable": 996,
        "restoreRate": 50
      }
    }
  }
}
```

The  [GraphQL API in Shopify](https://shopify.dev/docs/admin-api/graphql/getting-started#the-graphql-endpoint) for production is available at this endpoint:

```
https://**{{ SHOPIFY_SHOP }}**.myshopify.com/admin/api/2020-07/graphql.json
```

**{{ SHOPIFY_SHOP }}** represents the name of the Shopify instance. This endpoint is secure by default. 

In order to query Shopify from an application such as Web Application or a mobile application we need to create a **Private Application.**

### Creation of a "Private Application" in Shopify

A link  "**Managed private apps**" is available in the "**Apps**" section of Shopify.

![i1.png](./images/i1.png)

**A private application is characterized by:**

- The name of developer
    - The email of the developer for support
- A list of permissions

    The Read / Write access policy on each entity defined in the Shopify Back-office

    - Customers
    - Orders
    - Products
    - Price Rules
    - Analytics
    - Shippings

**The API is divided in 2 parts:**

- The admin API that gives access to all the entities
- The storefront API used to develop customized customer-facing experiences on web or mobile

Creation of a private application

In **Apps** click on the button "**Create new private app"**

![i2.png](./images/i2.png)

Enter the name of the application and the e-mail support:

![i3.png](./images/i3.png)

Configure the security policy for each entity

![i4.png](./images/i4.png)

Click save and create App on the dialog.

Obtain the security parameters

![i5.png](./images/i5.png)

- **API Key** : represents the logical user identity of the application
- **Password** : the password used by the application
- **Shared Secret** : used a token in each programmatic call

Once we have an application we can use an API client to test and create our graphQL queries.

## Insomnia

[Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/) is a very powerful Desktop API Client for REST and GraphQL tool to explore and test REST and GraphQL Apis. Insomnia can be download at : [https://insomnia.rest/](https://insomnia.rest/)

### Workspace creation in Insomnia

Click create new "Workspace"

![7.png](./images/i7.png)

Workspaces are a core concept used for isolating projects within Insomnia.

The variable and secrets shared can be stored in an Environment. 

Environment can be used to store environment variables, that are referenced and used by each query in a workspace.

For example for our example we store the following definitions:

```json
{
  "SHOPIFY_SHOP": "test",
  "SHOPIFY_ACCESS_TOKEN": "FF",
  "SHOPIFY_API_KEY": "X",
  "SHOPIFY_PASSWORD": "X"
}
```

### Create of a GraphQL in a workspace

In our Workspace choose create **"New Request"**

![08.png](./images/i8.png)

Edit the name of the request and chose "**POST**" method:

![09.png](./images/i9.png)

Type the URL

![10.png](./images/i10.png)

SHOPIFY_SHOP represent the variable we have created in the Environment 

Configure the Query

```graphql
{
  products(first: 3) {
    edges {
      cursor
      node {
        handle
        title
      }
    }
  }
}
```

![11.png](./images/i11.png)

Configure the security with Basic authentication

Choose the variable "**SHOPIFY_API_KEY**" and "**SHOPIFY_PASSWORD**" for **username** and **password**

![12.png](./images/i12.png)

Create an Header in the query

![13.png](./images/i13.png)

We need to configure the query to disable the cookies

A right click on the query definition can be used to open the settings of the query

![14.png](./images/i14.png)

Send cookies and store cookies must be **disabled**

![15](./images/i15.png)

We can now test our query with a click on the send button

### Et Voila !!

### Generate a query for your target language

A cool feature of Insomnia is the code generation of a client
